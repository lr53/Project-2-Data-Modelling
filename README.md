## Data Modeling with Postgres

### Introduction

Sparkify want to analyze their data they've been collectiong on songs and user activity on their music streaming app. They are particularly interested in understanding what songs userss listen to. User activity is stored in a directory of JSON logs and their is JSON metadata about the songs on the app. However they have no easy way to query the data. In this project data is modelled in a Postgres database and an ETL pipeline is created. 


### Schema

The schema is as below for the Sparkify database.



Project Description
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
